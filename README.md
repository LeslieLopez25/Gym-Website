<h1>Fitness For All</h1>

<h2>A Tailwind CSS website.</h2>

<p>This project is created Tailwind CSS. I created this following the tutorial of Traversy Media. I've changed the images and color scheme. This project was the first time that I used Tailwind and I enjoyed building this and seeing how easy it is to use it.</p>
